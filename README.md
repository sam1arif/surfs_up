 3. The standard deviation in temperatures during the month of June less (3.26) than that of December (3.75). This means that temperature in June tend to be on the warmer end while it is on the slightly colder end in the month of Decemeber.


## Summary:
  
  The reason we analyzed the temperatures for the months of June and December is because these are prime vacation months (summer and winter/Christmas) in Oahu, Hawaii. As we can see in the results section, the month of June has great temperature range for surfing and ice cream for tourists. The month of December is also good, especially during the hotter parts of the day when the sun is shinning, which is when most likely people will be surfing and eating ice cream. 
  
  In order to make our plan for the Surfs n' Shake shop even more solid, we need to factor in percipitation during those months and analyze the relationship between temperature ranges and percipitation.
